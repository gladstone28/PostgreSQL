# Welcome To Design Databases With PostgreSQL

### Let’s take a look at what’s coming up in this path!

Welcome to the Design Databases With PostgreSQL skill path! Let’s take a look at what is coming up in this path. This path is broken into five main sections — by the end of the path, you should have the skills you need to design and implement your very own database.

## Part 1: What Is A Database?
In this section, we’ll introduce you to the concept of a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). We’ll look at some of the differences between different systems, and focus in on PostgreSQL, the RDBMS that we will primarily be using in this path. We will also help you get PostgreSQL setup on your own computer, so you can use the skills you learn on Codecademy in the real world.

## Part 2: What Can I Do With A Database?
Now that you understand what a database is, and have one up and running, it’s time to learn more about what you can DO with a database. In this section, we’ll query a database to pull interesting information from it. In addition to querying, we’ll apply aggregate functions like SUM() to our data. Finally, we’ll use JOINs to link multiple tables together. This section concludes with a project where you can test your querying skills on a massive baseball dataset to find some interesting statistics.

## Part 3: How Do I Make And Populate My Own Database?
This is where the design part of the course starts to take center stage. Now that you know what a database is, and what you can use databases for, it’s time to start thinking about how to create a database. We’ll explore all of the parts of a Database Schema, including keys, relationships, and basic constraints. At the end of this section, you’ll be asked to design a database on a topic that you’re unfamiliar with!

## Part 4: How Do I Make Sure My Database Stays Intact?
One of the advantages of using a RDBMS to store your data is that you can constrain your data to be exactly how you want it to be. This allows you to be more effective when querying your data — since you can define exactly what your data should look like, you can anticipate exactly how you will use it! This section will dive into the different ways you can constrain your data.

## Part 5: How Do I Make Sure My Database Stays Fast?
In the last section of the course, we’ll focus on optimizing your database. After all, your database is pretty useless if it takes too long to do anything with it. We’ll cover two main ideas in this section. The first is indexes. Learn what an index is, and when (and when not!) to use one. Then, learn about the concept of normalization. By properly normalizing your database, you can optimize your database to suit your particular needs.

Let’s get started!
