WHAT IS A DATABASE SCHEMA?
Identifying Your Tables
7 min
In this exercise, we are going to delve into designing our own database schema. The purpose of our database is to enable an online bookstore to show its catalog of books to potential buyers and for a buyer to preview sample chapters for a selected book. Imagine you are book browsing on Amazon.com.

After gathering information for this database, we found that our database should have:

book information which includes title, isbn, number of pages, price, description, and publisher for an overview of the book
author information which includes author bio and contact
book chapter information which includes chapter number, chapter title and chapter content that is available for online previewing
As you can see, there is quite a lot of information to maintain in our database. The next step would be to organize the information in our database into tables.

Take a look at a sample row below if we decide to store all our information in a single table. For the sake of space, we made the chapter information very small and unrealistic. If you would like to make this image bigger, you can expand this panel, or find the image here.
